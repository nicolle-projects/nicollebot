# nicollebot — Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-08

## Overview
nicollebot is designed with **privacy by default** and **minimal data retention**.
The bot stores only what is required to provide **nicollebot game win tracking and leaderboards**.

## What nicollebot stores
nicollebot stores only:

* **Discord platform user IDs**
* **nicollebot game win counts per game category (integers)**

This data exists solely to power **nicollebot game leaderboard winner tracking**.

Stored data is **not associated with real-world identity** and **cannot be used to identify a person outside the Discord platform**.

## What nicollebot does NOT store
nicollebot does not store:

* Message content
* Usernames or nicknames
* Avatars
* Timestamps of user choices
* Analytics or tracking identifiers
* IP addresses, emails, phone numbers, or payment information
* Cross-server behavioral history or profiling
* Any data related to **non-nicollebot systems, bots, or server tools**

## Where data is stored
**nicollebot game leaderboard data** is stored **locally on the bot host machine**
as a JSON file and treated as **private operational data**.

The bot does not use:

* External databases for core functionality
* Third-party analytics
* External telemetry services

## Why this data is stored
* To track **nicollebot game wins** for **nicollebot game leaderboards**
* To support **global and per-game win counts within nicollebot only**

## Data retention
**nicollebot game leaderboard win counts** are retained until:
* A seasonal reset occurs, **or**
* A user requests removal of their **nicollebot leaderboard entries**

## Data removal requests (privacy-critical)
Users may request removal of their **nicollebot game leaderboard data**
(the only retained user data).

### Removal process
1. The user contacts the **bot owner via Discord DM**.
2. The owner removes the user’s ID from **all nicollebot leaderboard records**.
3. The owner confirms completion **privately**.

### Scope clarification
* Removal applies **only to data stored by nicollebot**.
* Requests related to **other bots, moderation logs, or server-stored data**
  must be directed to the **server owner or administrators**,
  as those systems operate under separate policies.

### Notes
* Removal is **irreversible**.
* Only **nicollebot game win-count entries** exist to remove.

## Data sharing
nicollebot does **not sell, share, or publish stored data** with third parties.
nicollebot leaderboard data is **not externally exposed by the bot**.

## Security of stored data
* Stored data is **minimal (Discord IDs and win-count integers only)**.
* Credentials (bot token) are stored via **environment configuration**
  and are **never hard-coded**.
* nicollebot does **not intentionally transmit leaderboard data** to third parties.

## Children’s privacy
nicollebot is **not intended to collect personal information from children**.
Because the bot stores only **Discord platform user IDs and nicollebot game win counts**,
it is designed to **avoid collecting sensitive personal data**.

## Changes to this policy

If the **nicollebot data model or retention behavior changes**,
this policy must be **updated before deploying the modified system**.

## Contact

For privacy requests (including **data removal**):
➡️ Users must contact the **bot owner via Discord DM**.

nicollebot does **not provide email-based support** in order to:
* Reduce spam risk
* Prevent impersonation
* Maintain Discord identity verification

For privacy requests (including **nicollebot game leaderboard data removal**), users must contact the **bot owner via Discord DM**.
