# nicollebot — Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2026-02-08

## Overview

nicollebot is designed with **privacy by default** and **minimal data retention**.
The bot stores only what is required to provide nicollebot game win tracking and leaderboards.

## What nicollebot stores

nicollebot stores only:
- **Discord platform user IDs**
- **nicollebot game win counts per game category (integers)**

This data exists solely to power **nicollebot game leaderboard** winner tracking.

Stored data is **not associated with real-world identity** and cannot be used to identify a person outside the Discord platform.

## What nicollebot does NOT store

nicollebot does not store:
- Message content
- Usernames or nicknames
- Avatars
- Timestamps of user choices
- Analytics or tracking identifiers
- IP addresses, emails, phone numbers, or payment information
- Cross-server behavioral history or profiling
- Any data related to **non-nicollebot systems, bots, or server tools**

## Where data is stored

**nicollebot game leaderboard data** is stored **locally** on the bot host machine as a JSON file and treated as **private operational data**.

The bot does not use:
- External databases for core functionality
- Third-party analytics
- External telemetry services

## Why this data is stored

- To track **nicollebot game wins** for **nicollebot game leaderboards**
- To support global and per-game win counts within nicollebot only

## Data retention

**nicollebot game leaderboard win counts** are retained until:
- A seasonal reset occurs, or
- A user requests removal of their leaderboard entries

## Data removal requests (privacy-critical)

Users may request removal of their **nicollebot game leaderboard** entries (the only retained user data).

Process:
1) The user contacts the bot owner via **Discord DM**.
2) The owner removes the user’s ID entries from all **nicollebot game leaderboard** categories.
3) The owner confirms completion without sharing leaderboard contents.

Notes:
- Removal is irreversible.
- Only **nicollebot game leaderboard** win-count entries exist to remove.
- Requests related to **other bots, moderation logs, or server-stored data** must be directed to the **server owner or server administrators**, as those systems are outside nicollebot’s control and governed by separate policies.

## Data sharing

nicollebot does **not** sell or share **nicollebot game leaderboard data** with third parties.
This data is not published externally by the bot.

## Security of stored data

- Stored data is minimal (**Discord IDs + win-count integers only**).
- Credentials (bot token) are stored via environment configuration and are never hard-coded.
- The bot does not intentionally transmit **nicollebot game leaderboard data** to third parties.

## Children’s privacy

nicollebot is not intended to collect personal information from children.
Because the bot only stores **Discord platform user IDs and nicollebot game win counts**, it is designed to avoid collecting sensitive personal data.

## Changes to this policy

If the **nicollebot data model** changes, this policy must be updated **before** deploying the changed system.

## Contact

For privacy requests (including **nicollebot game leaderboard data removal**), users must contact the **bot owner via Discord DM**.
